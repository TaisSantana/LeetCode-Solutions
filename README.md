# LeetCode Solutions in Java

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in Java.  
- Each problem has its own file with a class named after the problem.
- Each file includes a main method for testing purposes, so you can run it locally to see the output.

## Naming Convention

- **File format:** `<ProblemName>.java`  
  *Example:* `RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray.java`

- **Class names** follow the same pattern: `RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray`

- **Variable names** are written in English for clarity and consistency.

---

## Notes

- Solutions include **comments explaining the problem, logic, and complexity**.  
- `main` methods are included for **local testing**, but for LeetCode submission, only the `Solution` class is needed.
